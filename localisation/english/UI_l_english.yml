 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "§YDivided World§!"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "§YThe global landscape finds itself starkly divided between the Capitalist West and the Malenyevist East, with mounting global tensions compelling nations to make a critical choice in this increasingly hostile world. The two formidable global superpowers teeter on the brink of unleashing nuclear annihilation upon each other, intensifying the specter of a devastating conflict.§!"
 ARC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Arcasia ascended to global superpower status after enduring the Century of Revolutions, exerting its influence on a global scale and catalyzing the transition of numerous countries toward free-market capitalism. However, the emergence of the Malenyevist United Contana in the East poses a formidable challenge to Arcasia's global hegemony. This has ignited a simmering cold war between the two superpowers, steadily escalating as they confront each other, setting the stage for an increasingly volatile international landscape."
 LSP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Modern Lespia emerged in 1850 through a bloodless revolution that replaced the monarchy with a republic and ushered in sweeping free-market reforms, aligning it with Arcasia's influence in East Merkopa. Often referred to as 'the shining pearl,' Lespia is a major player in regional politics. However, beneath its outward beauty lies rampant corruption and a growing wealth gap. In recent years, Lespia has adopted isolationist and protectionist policies."
 AGN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Agnolia's modern history has been marked by a series of enduring hardships, starting with the Rumburgian invasion of Dome, followed with the economic stagnation triggered by the Sordish recession, and currently, Valgsland's escalating belligerence in response to Agnolian occupation of Heljiland. Despite these formidable challenges, the resilient Agnolian populace has remained steadfast in their adherence to core beliefs. Nevertheless, as Valgsland continues to escalate tensions and with the looming possibility of a significant shift in Sordish politics, the country finds itself compelled to explore potential alliances beyond its immediate region."
 SRD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Republic of Sordland is mired in crisis due to President Alphonso's reckless leadership, resulting in an unavoidable recession. Within the ruling United Sordland Party, calls for a new Chairman and the potential split in USP leadership benefit the Liberal and Nationalist movements. Ongoing constitutional reform debates and Bludish minority demands add to the turmoil as Sordland approaches an election season, signaling a potential shift in power or a return to tradition."
 RUM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rumburg has perennially grappled with discord among its neighboring nations. Although it commands extensive territories, the kingdom faces constraints due to its finite resources and finds itself isolated in the diplomatic arena, save for a handful of allies across various regions. While Rumburg was able to endure the tumultuous Century of Revolutions, internal factions are now advocating for sweeping reforms. Amid this backdrop, Queen Beatrice, with an eye on consolidating her own power, contemplates a potential military incursion into Sordland, a long-standing adversary that has harbored hostility for decades."
 VLG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Valgsland's origins can be traced back to revolutionary leaders, including Wilhelm Ulbrik, who declared a democratic republic, drawing inspiration from the recent Malenyevist revolution in United Contana. In 1940, following Ulbrik's passing, Chancellor Emmerich Hegel assumed leadership and initiated sweeping de-Ulbrikization reforms. These reforms not only distanced Valgsland from Malenyevism but also involved a comprehensive restructuring of the People's Party, with a primary aim to increase public involvement in politics. This transformative period in Valgsland's history marked the birth of Valgslandian Socialism."
 FSR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "United Contana emerged from the remnants of the former Kontanian Empire, adopting the ideological tenets outlined by Carlos Marcia, and underwent a profound transformation into a socialist federative republic. Encompassing an expansive continent, Contana stands as a sprawling nation characterized by a rich tapestry of ethnicities and cultures, all coalescing under a single banner. As the global cold war steadily intensifies and Chairman Malenyev's health deteriorates, Contana becomes increasingly susceptible to volatility, with internal and external forces vying to impose their visions upon the nation."
