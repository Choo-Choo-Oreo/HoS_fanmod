 #Events
  rum.t:0 "Escalating Tensions"
  rum.d:0 "On monday morning, the Queen gave a speech in the chaimbers of Parliament. Ever since the Queen's ascension to the throne, the Parliament and the Crown have been at odds with eachother, as the Queen would use her royal powers to block any meaningful reform while also consoldiating her own position. With the  aftermath of the Global Trade war, the political rivalry has escalated into a full on crisis as both sides argue for drastically different solutions for handling the economy."
  rum.a:0 "The political chess game has begun."
  rum.suspend.t:0 "Royal Decree - Suspension of Parliament"
  rum.suspend.d:0 "The Queen has officially disbanded the parliament. Almost instantly, the politicians began rallying up the people as the streets of Thornsbourg filled with people protesting the decision. The police had been able to contain the protests, but as more and more people started to show up, the situation  got worse. The military had been called by the Queen to deal with the protest, and the sight of armed soldiers on the streets have raised tensions significantly. The next moments will decide Rumburg's fate."
  rum.suspend.a:0 "The Military disperses the protesters!"
  rum.suspend.b:0 "The Police blockades are overrun and the Military is overwhelmed, Thornbourg falls!"
  rum.defundmil.t:0 "Parliamentary Act - Military Budget Revision"
  rum.defundmil.d:0 "The military has been hindering our development as more and more resources were given to the growing MIC. This proposed act will limit the % of GDP that can be directed towards the military, while also limiting the expansion of the military industry. The general staff all have voiced their distain,  and have began planning a military takeover if the act is passed. Tensions in the capital are rising, as both sides confront eachother. The fate of Rumburg is in the balance."
  rum.defundmil.a:0 "The Military steps down, and the act is passed!"
  rum.defundmil.b:0 "The Military storms the Parliament!"
