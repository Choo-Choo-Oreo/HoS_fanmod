 tradewar.1.d:0 "In a rapidly evolving political landscape, the Gulf of Rika has emerged as a significant focal point for global attention. With the recent changes in Nibiya's leadership resulting in a shift towards a more nationalist government, tensions between the Arcasian 3rd Fleet and the United Contanan Rika Fleet have escalated. A major naval confrontation between United Contana and Arcasia at the Gulf of Rika has caused a global trade disruption, as the gulf oversees half of the global trade flows. Following the event Arcasia imposed considerable tariffs on CSP goods which triggered a temporary trade embargo on all Arcasian goods from the CSP. The massive financial impact was felt all around the world."

The international response was mixed, with both ATO and CSP condemning the act, while Rumburg refused to publish a statement. The only country who congratulated the President was the Wehzek President, Wiktor Smolak."

 srd.election.d:0 "Once again, Sords are going to the polls to elect a new president. Ever since Tarquin Soll's departure from politics, and the failed democratic reforms of Ewald Alphonso have caused the USP to slowly lose support within the general populace. The elections were close, with the PFJP being neck-to-neck with the USP. But in the end, only one party can prevail, and that is..."

 srd.2.t:0 "State of Emergency"
 srd.2.d:0 "With the support of the Supreme Court, Anton Rayne finalized the Emergency draft and suspended all talks of reform. At the Grand National Assembly, he gave a historic speech. The assmebly roared in all types of responses, with USP and NFP politicians apploading the President's hard stance against enemies of the state. Prominent figures within the Independents and PFJP protested the declaration, but were quickly silenced by the Speaker's gavel."

 srd.3.t:0 "Murder at the Maroon Palace"
 srd.3.d:0 "Sordland has been shocked by grave news today as an elected member of parliament has been shot dead in a suspected political assassination. Bernard Circas, a prominent independent MP known for his communist romanticism has been murdered leaving the Maroon Palace grounds after the inauguration ball of Anton Rayne. Reports indicate a politically motivated assault by the far-right nationalists of the Young Sords. Shocking photographs have been leaked to the press showing blood dripped stairs of the Maroon Palace. Police sirens were heard around the clock today as the Holsord Police Force increased security measures around the capital. The fact that such a violent act happened at the heart of the capital during the new President’s inauguration celebrations has worried many citizens. The Red Youth has reported to have promised revenge. This seems like it has the potential to be a spark that would swirl Sordland into the political violence of the 1920’s."

 srd.5.d:0 "Chief Justice Orso Hawker is a well known and respected figure amongst Sollists. Upon a request of the President, Chief Justice Orso arrived at the Maroon Palace for a discussion. He outlined the foundations of a potential state of emergency to be declared in Sordland, following the tragic events that took place during the Inauguration. Although both men agree on this direction for the country, one thing has yet to be decided. How far should the emergency decree go?"

 srd.6.d:0 "The reformist wing of the USP has slowly grown larger and larger as the general populace's demands for reforms grow. If left unchecked, they can influence the party from within, or in a worst case scenario, take leadership entirely. We cannot allow a part of the USP to collaborate with the opposition. This ends now."
